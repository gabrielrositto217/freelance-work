The objective for this task was to consolidate fields between different tabs in a Google Sheet into one master sheet, as per business requirement.
This meant joining/copying the data and scheduling the script for automatic runs every day.

NOTE: Code/comments are mostly in Spanish as the client was from Mexico.
